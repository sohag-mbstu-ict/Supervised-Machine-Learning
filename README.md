# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables.
### Simple linear regression example
You are a social researcher interested in the relationship between income and happiness. You survey 500 people whose incomes range from 15k to 75k and ask them to rank their happiness on a scale from 1 to 10.
Your independent variable (income) and dependent variable (happiness) are both quantitative, so you can do a regression analysis to see if there is a linear relationship between them.

In the above plot, we can see the real values observations in green dots and predicted values are covered by the red regression line. The regression line shows a correlation between the dependent and independent variable.

The good fit of the line can be observed by calculating the difference between actual values and predicted values. But as we can see in the above plot, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence our model is good for the training set.

In the above plot, there are observations given by the blue color, and prediction is given by the red regression line. As we can see, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence we can say our Simple Linear Regression is a good model and able to make good predictions.
