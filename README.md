# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables.

### Simple linear regression example
You are a social researcher interested in the relationship between income and happiness. You survey 500 people whose incomes range from 15k to 75k and ask them to rank their happiness on a scale from 1 to 10.
Your independent variable (income) and dependent variable (happiness) are both quantitative, so you can do a regression analysis to see if there is a linear relationship between them.

In the above plot, we can see the real values observations in green dots and predicted values are covered by the red regression line. The regression line shows a correlation between the dependent and independent variable.

The good fit of the line can be observed by calculating the difference between actual values and predicted values. But as we can see in the above plot, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence our model is good for the training set.

In the above plot, there are observations given by the blue color, and prediction is given by the red regression line. As we can see, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence we can say our Simple Linear Regression is a good model and able to make good predictions.


# Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.

In this piece, I am going to introduce the Multiple Linear Regression Model. Our problem is about modeling how R&D, administration, and marketing spendings and the state will influence the profit of a company. There are 50 startups data in our dataset.

## regressor_OLS.summary() is shown below

## Look at the highest p-values and remove it. In this condition x3(third  dummy variable has the highest one (0.767)

## regressor_OLS.summary() is shown below

## Look at the highest p-values and remove it. In this condition x1(first  dummy variable has the highest one (0.020)

## regressor_OLS.summary() is shown below

## Look at the highest p-values and remove it. In this condition x3(third  dummy variable has the highest one (0.767)

## That’s it. The highest impact variable
